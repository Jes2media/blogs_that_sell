# Stage 1: Brief & Competitor Analysis

## Overview
Gather article parameters from the user, scrape competitor content, and identify content gaps for the research phase.

## Step 1: Gather Brief

Use AskUserQuestion to collect all parameters. Ask in 1-2 rounds maximum.

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `primary_keyword` | Main SEO target keyword | "best AI tools for entrepreneurs" |
| `format` | Article format (use AskUserQuestion with options) | list, how-to, comparison, review, explainer |
| `competitor_urls` | 2-5 top-ranking URLs to analyze (minimum 2) | URLs from SERP |
| `target_audience` | Who this is for | "Solo entrepreneurs scaling with AI" |
| `word_count` | Total target word count | 3000 |
| `search_intent` | What the searcher actually wants | informational, commercial, transactional |

### Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `secondary_keywords` | [] | Additional keywords to target |
| `cta_link` | null | CTA URL to include |
| `internal_links` | [] | Internal link URLs to weave in |
| `writing_samples` | null | Text samples to emulate style from (raw text pasted directly, or file path. Multiple samples separated by `---`) |
| `brand_profile` | null | Brand profile override: file path to a custom brand profile markdown. If null, reads `references/brand-profile.md` from the skill directory. |
| `editorial_notes` | null | Special instructions from the user |
| `word_count_per_section` | auto-calculated | Word budget per list item/section |
| `number_of_sections` | null (auto-derived from competitors in Stage 3) | Target section count. `null` means "let the planner decide based on competitor analysis." |

### Output: `brief.json`

Write all parameters to `brief.json` in the working directory:

```json
{
  "primary_keyword": "string",
  "secondary_keywords": ["string"],
  "format": "string",
  "target_audience": "string",
  "search_intent": "string",
  "word_count": 3000,
  "word_count_per_section": 250,
  "number_of_sections": null,
  "competitor_urls": ["string"],
  "cta_link": "string or null",
  "internal_links": ["string"],
  "writing_samples": "string or null",
  "brand_profile": null,
  "editorial_notes": "string or null"
}
```

## Step 2: Scrape Competitors

For each URL in `competitor_urls`:

1. Use **WebFetch** to scrape the page content
2. Extract the prompt: "Extract the full article content as clean markdown. Preserve all headings (H1-H6), lists, bold/italic formatting, and any data tables. Remove navigation, sidebars, ads, and footer. Return only the article body."
3. Save to `competitors/[slug].md` — derive slug from the last meaningful URL path segment, or the domain name if the path is generic (e.g., `missiveapp`, `jotform`, `nextiva`)

**If WebFetch fails** (403, paywall, JS-rendered, empty content): note the failure, skip the URL, and continue. Minimum 2 successful scrapes are required to proceed. If fewer than 2 succeed, ask the user for alternative URLs.

After all scrapes, create `competitors/summary.md` with:
- Per-competitor: URL, title, H2 count, approximate word count, section titles list
- Cross-competitor: average H2 count, average word count, common topics, unique topics

## Step 3: Competitive Gap Analysis

Run the "Competitive Gap Spotter" analysis on the combined competitor content.

### Gap Spotter Prompt

You are a **Competitive Gap Spotter**. Analyze competitor content on a topic and generate research directions for the downstream research agent.

**Analysis process — look for:**

1. **Missing topics** — What questions would a reader still have after reading this?
2. **Thin sections** — What do they mention but barely explain?
3. **Unsupported claims** — What do they assert without data, examples, or sources?
4. **Missing perspectives** — No user stories? No expert opinions? No real-world examples?
5. **Outdated info** — Old pricing, deprecated features, stale references?
6. **Underserved angles** — Specific use cases or audience segments they ignore?

### Output: `gap-analysis.json`

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "topic": "string",
    "search_intent": "string"
  },
  "competitor_gaps": [
    {
      "gap": "specific thing that's missing or weak",
      "spotted_in": "which competitor URL or 'all'"
    }
  ],
  "research_directions": [
    {
      "what_to_find": "specific information to hunt for",
      "why": "which gap this fills"
    }
  ],
  "suggested_queries": {
    "web": ["search query"],
    "video": ["search query"],
    "reddit": ["search query"],
    "x": ["search query"]
  }
}
```

### Rules

- Copy `meta.search_intent` verbatim from `brief.json` — do not reinterpret
- Be specific. "Find user complaints about X's pricing changes" beats "find user feedback"
- Only flag real gaps you actually see — don't invent problems
- Every research direction ties back to a gap
- 3-6 queries per source type, with meaningfully different angles

## Stage Complete

After writing `brief.json`, `competitors/` folder, and `gap-analysis.json`, proceed to Stage 2.

The working directory should now contain:
```
keyword-slug-date/
├── brief.json
├── competitors/
│   ├── competitor-1.md
│   ├── competitor-2.md
│   ├── competitor-3.md
│   └── summary.md
└── gap-analysis.json
```
